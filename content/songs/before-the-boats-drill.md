## Suno v5 Optimized Lyrics

### Style Prompt for Suno:
```
Dark drill beat, 140 BPM, sliding 808s, ominous piano stabs, minimal melody. 
Male vocal, dry and aggressive, prioritize lyrical clarity and consonant punch 
over melody, short bars, chant-style hooks, minimal reverb, no ad-libs. 
Educational conscious drill, calm menace, precise diction, front-of-mix vocals.
```

### Lyrics

**[Intro – Spoken, Low, Cold]**
```
This ain't folklore.
This is classification, law, and land.
Listen close.
```

**[Hook – Chant, Aggressive]**
```
Before the boats, documented presence
Dark skin natives in explorer sentences
Change the label, change the census
Paper kill tribes, dodge consequences
Before the boats, facts first
Land lost when race got reassigned
If history solid, why rewrite?
Truth don't fear archived light
```

**[Verse 1 – Drill Rap, Controlled Aggression]**
```
Pre-1492 wasn't empty land
That myth made conquest easy to brand
Doctrine of Discovery set the frame
Call us heathen, then claim our name

Explorer logs say "Ethiopian tone"
Carolina coast, not Africa shown
Same page say Asian features too
Means phenotype range, not slave debut

Balboa saw black men, armed, free
Years before trade economics spree
If Africans only came chained and sold
Explain free black villages Spaniards told
```

**[Hook – Short, Hard]**
```
Before the boats, read the logs
Not the textbooks revised for laws
Race got weaponized for land
Erase tribes, then expand the plan
```

**[Verse 2 – Faster, Sharper]**
```
Census ain't neutral, it's policy tech
One checkbox decide who own land next
Indian to "Colored," same bloodline
Now no treaty rights by design

Virginia 1924, paper attack
Birth records changed, no going back
That's genocide—quiet, clean
Administrative erasing of a people unseen

DNA say admixture post-contact
That don't erase who was here intact
Law identity ain't blood truth
Paper move faster than ancestry roots
```

**[Hook – Educational Emphasis]**
```
Before the boats, classification war
Race was the weapon, land the reward
If you don't audit who named who what
You miss the motive behind the plot
```

**[Bridge – Half-Time, Reflective]**
```
This ain't "we not African," that's weak debate
This is dual truth manipulated by state
Africa is lineage, America location
One side cut to block land conversation
```

**[Verse 3 – Final, Authoritative]**
```
Ask who funded books, who paid the grants
Who benefit most from "vanished Indians" stance
If Black mean foreign by default
No indigenous claim can ever vault

If truth fringe, test it, don't suppress
Peer review ain't fear unless it threatens checks
History that bans questions ain't strong
It's maintained, repeated, legally prolonged
```

**[Final Hook – Chant, Stripped Beat]**
```
Before the boats, verify
Read the margins they won't amplify
Before the boats, no myth
Just law, land, race, and paperwork
Truth don't need belief
Only records—and who changed them first
```

**[Outro – Spoken, Menacing Calm]**
```
If the story can't survive an audit…
It was never history.
It was governance.
```
