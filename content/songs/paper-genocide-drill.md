### Style Prompt for Suno:
```
Dark drill beat, 140 BPM, heavy 808s, minimal melody, dry male vocal, 
aggressive but clear delivery, educational conscious drill, precise diction, 
clinical tone, front-of-mix vocals, no ad-libs.
```

### Lyrics

**[Intro – Spoken, Cold]**
```
This wasn't war.
This was paperwork.
```

**[Hook – Chant, Short Bars]**
```
Paper genocide—no guns
Names erased—ink run
Indian gone—"Colored" now
Same blood—new column
Paper genocide—real
Quiet kill—no appeal
If the tribe "disappeared"
Check the files—not the field
```

**[Verse 1 – Tight, Educational]**
```
Census ain't facts—it's control
One checkbox rewrite a soul
Indian last year, Black this time
No treaty rights once the label slide

If you ain't on a reservation map
They mark you "colored," close the gap
Can't claim land, can't claim law
That's not theory—that's protocol

They didn't need bullets or chains
Just forms, ink, and name changes
Erase the category, problem solved
That's how whole nations dissolved
```

**[Mini-Hook – Teaching]**
```
Who counted who?
Who chose the race?
Who gained land
When tribes got erased?
```

**[Verse 2 – Faster, Sharper]**
```
Virginia 1924—fact
Birth records edited back
If you was Indian yesterday
State say "Black"—case closed, stamped

Midwives ordered what to write
Doctors told to get it "right"
Same family, same address
Different race—zero process

That's genocide by administration
Not fire, not war—classification
When identity live on paper
Power decide who exists later
```

**[Hook – Repeat]**
```
Paper genocide—no guns
Names erased—ink run
Indian gone—"Colored" now
Same blood—new column
Paper genocide—real
Quiet kill—no appeal
If the tribe "disappeared"
Check the files—not the field
```

**[Bridge – Half-Time, Reflective]**
```
They say "prove your tribe"
But they destroyed the proof
Then blamed descendants
For the missing truth
```

**[Verse 3 – Final, Authoritative]**
```
This why recognition hard
Records broke by design
Can't trace lineage clean
When the state crossed every line

This ain't feelings, flags, or pride
This is archives falsified
If history honest, it stand review
If it panic, ask who benefits who
```

**[Final Hook – Chant]**
```
Paper genocide—verify
Read the margins—amplify
Paper genocide—understand
Laws erased people, not land
```

**[Outro – Spoken, Calm]**
```
If a people vanish on paper…
Check who held the pen.
```

## Educational Breakdown

### Key Historical References

1. **"Virginia 1924—fact"**
   - Virginia Racial Integrity Act of 1924
   - Walter Plecker systematically reclassified Virginia Indians as "colored"
   - Birth records were retroactively altered

2. **"Census ain't facts—it's control"**
   - Census classifications functioned as administrative tools
   - Changed access to treaty rights and land claims
   - Identity could be erased with a checkbox

3. **"Genocide by administration"**
   - Term "paper genocide" refers to documentary erasure
   - No physical violence required
   - Legal and bureaucratic methods more permanent

4. **"They say 'prove your tribe'"**
   - Federal recognition requires continuous documentation
   - When records were destroyed or altered, proof became impossible
   - Circular logic: need proof to exist, but proof was destroyed

### Why This Teaches Effectively

- **Process over outrage**: Explains HOW erasure happened
- **Verifiable claims**: Every bar references documented policy
- **No conspiracy theory**: Just administrative history
- **Empowers research**: Encourages listeners to check archives
- **Platform-safe**: Educational, not inflammatory

## Visual Treatment Notes

### Scene Concepts
- Census forms with checkboxes animating
- Birth certificates being altered
- Stamp: RECLASSIFIED (no gore, just bureaucracy)
- Archive files disappearing
- Maps with jurisdictions changing

### Color Palette
- Black, parchment, bronze
- Ink red only for stamps (minimal)
- Clinical, archival aesthetic

## Target Impact

This track should make listeners:
1. Understand administrative erasure as a historical tool
2. Question why recognition is so bureaucratically difficult
3. Realize genocide doesn't always look like violence
4. Want to research their own family's census records
