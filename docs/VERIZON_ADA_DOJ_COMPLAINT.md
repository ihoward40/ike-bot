### B. Disclosure of Disability to Verizon

I disclosed my disability status to Verizon on multiple occasions:

**October 2025 - Written Communications:**
- Letter to Executive Relations specifically mentioned verified disabled person
- Detailed ADA violations in correspondence
- Explained need for communication access

**November 2025 - Recorded Phone Calls:**

**Call #1 (Fios Support):**
- ME: "I'm a disabled person"
- ME: "I had a disability call" (explaining why I needed service restored)
- ME: Referenced need for "assisted communications"
- AGENT: No acknowledgment, no accommodation, no escalation

**Call #2 (Executive Relations - "Amir"):**
- ME: "I was forced to make a payment during an active billing dispute... I had to because I needed to make that [disability] call"
- ME: Explained the critical nature of maintaining service for disability communications
- AGENT: Acknowledged statements but provided no accommodation

**Verizon was CLEARLY AWARE of my disability status and essential service needs.**

---

### C. Denial of Reasonable Accommodations

### Accommodation Requested #1: Do Not Disconnect During Dispute Resolution

**Request:** Keep services active during billing dispute investigation, given disability-related need for communications

**Verizon's Response:**
- Disconnected wireless service during active dispute
- Disconnected Fios internet during active dispute
- Refused to restore without forced payment
- Executive Relations agent stated: "I cannot touch wireless account" (admitted inability to prevent disconnection)

**Result:** Lost access to ALL essential disability-related communications.

---

### Accommodation Requested #2: Extended Time for Dispute Resolution

**Request:** Allow time to gather payment documentation and work through complex billing issues without service interruption

**Verizon's Response:**
- Demanded immediate payment
- Continued disconnection despite active FCC complaint
- Refused to suspend collection during investigation
- Forced payment under threat of permanent service loss

**Result:** Created financial hardship and time pressure incompatible with disability limitations.

---

### Accommodation Requested #3: Unified Support Access

**Request:** Single point of contact who can address both Wireless and Fios issues together (given cognitive/administrative burden of dealing with siloed departments)

**Verizon's Response:**
- Maintained completely separate departments
- Forced repeated explanations to different agents
- Executive Relations admitted inability to access unified data
- No accommodation for the administrative burden this creates for disabled individual

**Result:** Exhaustion, confusion, inability to effectively resolve dispute.

---

### Accommodation Requested #4: Written Documentation and Extended Response Times

**Request:** Clear written explanations of charges, payment application, and dispute status (to accommodate cognitive processing needs)

**Verizon's Response:**
- Provided only template dismissal letter with no detail
- Refused to provide payment history
- Refused to explain $803.66 discrepancy
- Declared matter "final" without substantive response

**Result:** Unable to understand or respond effectively to Verizon's position.

---

### D. Discriminatory Forced Payments

**The Discriminatory Barrier:**

Verizon disconnected my services and demanded payment as a condition to restore them. For a disabled person on limited income ($XXX/month from SSA), being forced to pay **$400+** to restore essential services is a **discriminatory financial barrier**.

**Why This Is Discrimination:**

1. **Non-disabled persons:** May have alternative communication methods, greater financial resources, ability to wait for resolution

2. **Disabled person (me):** 
   - MUST have phone for SSA communications (no alternative)
   - MUST have internet for federal benefits portals
   - CANNOT afford $400+ forced payments on disability income
   - CANNOT wait for traditional resolution timelines due to time-sensitive disability matters

**Verizon imposed a condition (pay $400+) that has a disparate impact on disabled individuals who rely on telecommunications for essential disability-related activities.**

**This is EXACTLY what ADA prohibits: policies that disproportionately harm disabled individuals.**

---

### E. Service Disconnection = Denial of Benefits

**Federal Programs Affected by Service Disconnection:**

1. **Social Security Administration**
   - Cannot receive phone calls about my case
   - Cannot access SSA online portals (SSA.gov)
   - Cannot receive 2FA codes to log in
   - Risk missing critical deadlines

2. **Healthcare Coordination**
   - Cannot receive appointment reminders
   - Cannot get test result calls
   - Cannot coordinate prescriptions
   - Emergency medical risk

3. **Banking Access**
   - Cannot receive 2FA codes for bank access
   - Cannot manage finances electronically
   - Risk of missing payments for essentials

**Telecommunications = Essential Link to Federal Disability Benefits**

By disconnecting my services, Verizon effectively **denied my access to federal disability programs**, which violates ADA Title II principles (even though Verizon is not itself a federal entity, it provides the essential services that enable access to federal programs).

---

### F. Failure to Train Staff on ADA Requirements

**Evidence from Recorded Calls:**

1. **Support agents did not recognize ADA issue** when I disclosed disability
2. **No escalation to ADA compliance team** despite explicit disclosure
3. **No offers of reasonable accommodation**
4. **Executive Relations showed no awareness** of ADA obligations
5. **Template responses** with no consideration of disability impact

**This suggests Verizon has failed to train staff on:**
- Recognizing when ADA applies
- Offering reasonable accommodations
- Escalating to appropriate compliance personnel
- Documenting disability-related requests

---

### G. Retaliation After Disability Disclosure

**Timeline:**

1. **October 2025:** Disclosed disability in written complaints
2. **November 2025:** Services disconnected shortly after disclosure
3. **November 2025:** Executive Relations agent attempted to terminate call when I mentioned recording (creating evidence)
4. **December 2025:** Second disconnection, second forced payment demanded

**Pattern:** After I disclosed disability and filed regulatory complaints invoking ADA, Verizon escalated adverse actions rather than providing accommodations.

**This appears to be retaliation prohibited under:**
- **42 U.S.C. §12203** - ADA retaliation provision
- **29 CFR §1630.12** - Retaliation and coercion prohibited

---
