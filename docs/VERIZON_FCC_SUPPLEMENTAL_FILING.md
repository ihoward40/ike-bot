# FCC SUPPLEMENTAL EVIDENCE FILING
## Verizon Communications Inc. - Ongoing Violations During Active Complaint

**TO:** Federal Communications Commission  
**RE:** FCC Complaint [Insert Your FCC Complaint Number]  
**FROM:** Isiah Tarik Howard  
**DATE:** December 8, 2025  
**SUBJECT:** Supplemental Evidence - Verizon's Non-Response, Continued Violations, and Emergency Relief Request

---

## I. INTRODUCTION

I submit this supplemental filing to document Verizon Communications Inc.'s:

1. **Procedural dishonor** of FCC complaint process
2. **Continued violations** after FCC complaint filed
3. **Admission of systemic failures** in recorded calls
4. **Emergency harm** requiring immediate FCC intervention

**Verizon's response letter dated [date] demonstrates complete failure to comply with FCC good faith investigation requirements.**

---

## II. VERIZON'S NON-RESPONSIVE LETTER ANALYSIS

### A. Template Dismissal Without Investigation

Verizon's letter states:

> "We have reviewed the correspondence and determined that it is not valid to impose any obligations on Verizon."

**This statement violates FCC complaint handling requirements because:**

1. ✗ No line-by-line rebuttal of specific claims
2. ✗ No documentation of investigation performed
3. ✗ No payment history provided
4. ✗ No account records attached
5. ✗ No explanation of why services were disconnected during dispute
6. ✗ No acknowledgment of disability accommodation request
7. ✗ No response to ADA violations alleged
8. ✗ No response to payment discrepancy evidence

**FCC Standard:** 47 CFR §64.2400 requires telecommunications carriers to:
- Conduct good faith investigation of billing disputes
- Provide clear explanation of charges
- Address specific consumer concerns
- Maintain accurate records

**Verizon's letter fails all four requirements.**

---

### B. Liability Shifting Without Proof

Verizon claims:

> "Isiah Howard, alone and directly, is responsible for paying their bill per the terms and conditions of service…"

**Problems with this assertion:**

1. No contract provided to verify "terms and conditions"
2. No authenticated signature confirming agreement
3. No itemized billing showing valid charges
4. No response to documented payment confirmations provided by consumer
5. No acknowledgment of 10+ payments with confirmation numbers
6. No explanation for $803.66+ payment discrepancy

**Under 47 CFR §64.2400(d), the burden is on the carrier to demonstrate charges are valid when disputed by consumer.**

---

### C. Self-Declared "Finality" in Violation of FCC Authority

Verizon declares:

> "This is the final business decision of Verizon on this matter…"

**This violates FCC jurisdiction:**

- FCC complaints cannot be unilaterally closed by carriers
- Consumer protection process overrides internal company decisions
- Declaring "finality" while FCC complaint active = bad faith
- Attempt to circumvent regulatory oversight

---

### D. Admission of Incomplete Investigation

Most damaging admission:

> "Nothing in this letter should be construed as a full and complete recitation of the facts…"

**This is a confession that Verizon:**
- Did NOT fully investigate the complaint
- Did NOT gather complete facts
- Did NOT perform due diligence
- Yet STILL dismissed the complaint

**This is the definition of procedural dishonor under FCC standards.**

---

## III. RECORDED CALL EVIDENCE - VERIZON ADMISSIONS

Attached are transcripts of two calls made AFTER the FCC complaint was filed, demonstrating:

### Call 1: Fios Support Agent (November 2025)

**Key Admissions:**

1. **Services Disconnected During Active Dispute**
   - Customer: "My services were disconnected during an active billing dispute"
   - Agent: No dispute of this fact

2. **Dispute Not Visible in System**
   - Agent cannot see any record of billing dispute
   - No executive relations case notes visible
   - Suggests dispute was never properly logged OR intentionally removed

3. **Complete Dismissal of Detailed Allegations**
   - Customer read comprehensive list of violations (ADA, FDCPA, SEC, UCC)
   - Agent response: "It's almost like you didn't hear anything I said"
   - Zero acknowledgment, zero investigation, zero escalation

4. **Siloed Corporate Structure Prevents Resolution**
   - Agent admits: "I don't even see it in the system"
   - Fios and Wireless treated as completely separate companies
   - Executive Relations cannot access unified customer data
   - No path to unified resolution

**FCC Violation:** 47 CFR §64.2400 requires unified billing practices. A parent company cannot hide behind subsidiary structure to avoid regulatory compliance.

---

### Call 2: Executive Relations Agent (November 2025)

**Critical Admissions:**

1. **Executive Relations Cannot See Payment History**
   - Agent: "Last payment I'm seeing on your files account was back in June"
   - Customer has confirmation numbers for recent payments
   - **This proves systemic payment tracking failure**

2. **"Fatal Flaw" in Corporate Structure Acknowledged**
   - Customer: "It sounds like a fatal flaw... You can't see both sides, and you're an executive"
   - Agent: "I understand"
   - **Even highest level of support cannot resolve disputes**

3. **Cannot Prevent Disconnection During Active Dispute**
   - Customer: "Can you ensure that my line doesn't get disconnected?"
   - Agent: "I cannot touch a wireless account"
   - **Admits powerlessness to protect consumer during dispute resolution**

4. **Attempted Intimidation for Recording Call**
   - Agent: "If you're going to record the call, I'll have to disconnect"
   - Customer correctly asserts New Jersey one-party consent right
   - **Retaliation for creating evidence**

**FCC Implications:**
- If Executive Relations cannot resolve billing disputes, the FCC process is the ONLY path to resolution
- Verizon's corporate structure creates consumer harm
- Must be escalated to FCC enforcement division

---

## IV. CONTINUED VIOLATIONS AFTER FCC COMPLAINT

### A. Services Remain Disconnected

**Current Status as of December 8, 2025:**
- ✗ Wireless service: DISCONNECTED
- ✗ Fios internet service: DISCONNECTED
- ✗ Verizon refuses restoration even with payment
- ✗ Customer told: "cannot restore service even if payment made today"

**FCC Violation:** Disconnecting essential telecommunications during active FCC complaint = retaliation + unreasonable practice (47 USC §201).

---

### B. Forced Payments Under Duress

**Payment #1:** Customer forced to pay $400+ to restore wireless service temporarily
- Payment made under duress during active billing dispute
- Required to make disability-related phone call
- Violates FDCPA + FCC billing dispute protections

**Payment #2:** Customer being forced to make another payment TODAY (December 8, 2025)
- Services remain disconnected
- Verizon demanding payment as condition to restore service
- This is the SECOND forced payment during active FCC complaint

**FCC Analysis:** Forcing payments during active regulatory complaint = collection activity in violation of good faith dispute resolution requirements.

---

### C. ADA Violations - Disability Impact

**Verified Disability:** SSA disability determination effective August 1, 2024 (attached)

**Impact of Service Disconnection:**
1. Cannot receive SSA disability-related calls
2. Cannot access federal benefits portals (internet required)
3. Cannot receive 2FA authentication codes for banking
4. Cannot coordinate medical appointments
5. Cannot access emergency services
6. Cannot communicate with legal counsel
7. Cannot maintain trust operations

**ADA Violations:**
- No reasonable accommodation provided despite multiple requests
- Forced payment = discriminatory barrier for disabled individual
- Essential service disconnection blocks access to federal programs

**FCC Authority:** Section 255 of Communications Act requires telecommunications accessibility for individuals with disabilities.

---

## V. COLLECTION EMAILS DURING ACTIVE FCC COMPLAINT

Attached are recent Verizon collection emails demonstrating:

1. Continued collection notices despite active FCC complaint
2. Service suspension emails with "pay now" demands
3. Threats of "final termination" during regulatory review
4. Zero acknowledgment of pending FCC investigation

**These emails violate:**
- FCC good faith dispute resolution requirements
- FDCPA prohibition on collection during validation
- Consumer protection principles

---

## VI. EMERGENCY RELIEF REQUESTED

### A. Immediate Restoration of Services

**Request:** FCC order requiring Verizon to immediately restore:
1. Wireless phone service
2. Fios internet service

**Justification:**
- Essential services for disability-related communications
- Required for federal benefits coordination
- Necessary for emergency services access
- Cannot wait for full investigation timeline

**Authority:** FCC has emergency authority to order service restoration when disconnection is unreasonable or discriminatory (47 USC §202).

---

### B. Payment Investigation

**Request:** FCC order requiring Verizon to:
1. Provide complete payment history with all confirmation numbers
2. Conduct forensic accounting audit of all payments made
3. Explain discrepancy in payment posting
4. Suspend collection activity pending investigation

**Evidence of Payment Issues:**
- Customer provided 10+ payment confirmation numbers
- Verizon systems show "no payments" or "last payment in June"
- $803.66+ unaccounted for
- Executive Relations admits cannot see payment history

---

### C. Corporate Structure Investigation

**Request:** FCC investigation into whether Verizon's siloed subsidiary structure:
1. Violates unified billing requirements (47 CFR §64.2400)
2. Creates systematic consumer harm
3. Prevents effective dispute resolution
4. Constitutes unfair telecommunications practice

**Evidence:**
- Support agents cannot see unified customer data
- Executive Relations cannot access both Wireless + Fios accounts
- No internal escalation path exists
- Consumers forced to deal with separate entities for unified service

---

## VII. VERIZON'S PATTERN OF NON-COMPLIANCE

This is not an isolated incident. The evidence shows:

1. **Systematic dismissal** of consumer complaints
2. **Template responses** without investigation
3. **Retaliation** against consumers who file complaints
4. **Continued violations** after regulatory complaints filed
5. **Corporate structure** designed to avoid accountability

**FCC Precedent:** When carriers demonstrate pattern of non-compliance, enhanced enforcement action is warranted.

---

## VIII. REQUEST FOR FCC ACTION

I respectfully request the FCC to:

### Immediate Actions:
1. ✓ Order emergency restoration of wireless + Fios services
2. ✓ Suspend all collection activity pending investigation
3. ✓ Prevent negative credit reporting during investigation
4. ✓ Order Verizon to cease retaliatory actions

### Investigation Actions:
1. ✓ Require Verizon to produce complete payment records
2. ✓ Require authenticated contract and terms of service
3. ✓ Require documentation of alleged non-payment
4. ✓ Investigate corporate structure for consumer protection compliance
5. ✓ Investigate ADA accommodation failures

### Enforcement Actions:
1. ✓ Find Verizon's response letter non-compliant with FCC standards
2. ✓ Escalate to FCC Enforcement Bureau
3. ✓ Assess penalties for continued violations during complaint process
4. ✓ Order comprehensive remedial measures

## CONCLUSION

Verizon's conduct demonstrates:
- **Procedural dishonor** of FCC complaint process
- **Continued violations** after complaint filed
- **Systemic failures** in consumer protection
- **Emergency harm** requiring immediate relief

The FCC must act swiftly to:
1. Restore essential services
2. Investigate payment discrepancies
3. Address ADA violations
4. Hold Verizon accountable for bad faith conduct

**This is not merely a billing dispute. This is a telecommunications carrier using its market power to retaliate against a disabled individual who exercised regulatory complaint rights.**

The FCC's intervention is essential to protect both this consumer and the integrity of the complaint process itself.
