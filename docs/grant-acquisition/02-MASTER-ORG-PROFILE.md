## Organization Overview

### Standard Narrative (400 words)

**ISIAH TARIK HOWARD TRUST** (operating in coordination with **IKE Solutions LLC**) is a community-driven initiative focused on protecting families experiencing housing instability, legal challenges, and systemic discrimination. Founded in 2024 in Newark, New Jersey, the Trust emerged from direct lived experience with institutional barriers that disproportionately affect low-income families, disabled individuals, and those navigating complex legal systems.

**Our Mission**: To provide integrated support combining legal advocacy, technology-enabled case management, and family stabilization resources for individuals and families facing eviction, debt collection abuse, disability discrimination, and access-to-justice barriers.

**Our Approach**: We recognize that legal issues rarely exist in isolation. A family facing eviction often also faces disability accommodation denials, predatory debt collection, or barriers to public benefits. Our model addresses these intersecting challenges through:

- **Legal Advocacy & Rights Education**: Direct support for families navigating landlord-tenant disputes, ADA violations, debt collection harassment (FDCPA/TCPA violations), and consumer protection cases.
  
- **Technology for Access**: We build automation tools that simplify complex legal processes, reducing barriers for low-literacy and non-tech-savvy populations. Our systems include automated document generation, court calendar tracking, and secure evidence management.

- **Family Stabilization Services**: Emergency assistance, referrals for housing placement, connection to disability benefits (SSI/SSDI), and long-term case management to prevent recurring crises.

**Populations Served**: 
- Families with disabled household members navigating ADA compliance issues
- Low-income renters facing wrongful eviction or housing code violations
- Individuals experiencing debt collection abuse from creditors, utilities, and service providers
- Communities lacking access to affordable legal representation

**Geographic Focus**: Newark, NJ with capacity to expand statewide and nationally through technology platforms.

**Current Operations**: We operate through a lean, tech-enabled model leveraging automation (Make.com, Notion, Google Workspace) to maximize impact per dollar. Our founder, Isiah T. Howard, brings lived experience as an SSA-disabled individual who has navigated housing instability, wrongful eviction, and systemic discrimination—informing our trauma-informed, dignity-centered approach.

**Track Record**: While newly formalized in 2024, the Trust has successfully supported multiple families through:
- Verizon billing dispute resolution (ADA/FDCPA violations)
- Landlord-tenant negotiations preventing wrongful evictions
- Development of reusable legal templates for low-income families

**Vision**: A future where every family has access to competent legal advocacy, technology-enabled self-help tools, and integrated support that addresses the root causes of instability—not just the symptoms.
