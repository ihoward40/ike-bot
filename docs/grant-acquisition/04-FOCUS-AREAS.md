## Secondary Focus Areas (Tier 3)

### 6. Youth & Education

**Why This is Tier 3**:

- Would require additional capacity/expertise

**Potential Angles**:
- Legal aid for families with school-age children
- Rights education for youth (tenant rights, consumer protection)
- Youth employment and opportunity (as families stabilize)

---

### 7. Arts & Culture

**Why This is Tier 3**:
- Least aligned with current work
- Would require significant pivot or partnership
- Only pursue if: Funder specifically requests this and you can tie to housing/legal work (e.g., "preserving cultural communities threatened by displacement")

## Decision Matrix: Should We Apply?

Use this rubric to quickly assess grant fit (score 1-5 for each):

**Note**: Copy this matrix to a separate document or spreadsheet for each grant evaluation. Don't edit the documentation directly.

| **Eligibility**: Do we meet all requirements? | 3x | ___ | ___ |
| **Award Size**: Is amount worth the effort? | 2x | ___ | ___ |
| **Competition**: Realistic chance of winning? | 2x | ___ | ___ |

| **Timing**: Can we meet deadline with quality app? | 1x | ___ | ___ |
| **Restrictions**: Are there deal-breaker requirements? | 1x | ___ | ___ |

**Scoring Guide**:
- 5 = Perfect fit / Yes / High confidence
- 4 = Strong fit / Mostly yes / Good confidence
- 3 = Moderate fit / Somewhat / Uncertain
- 2 = Weak fit / Mostly no / Low confidence
- 1 = Poor fit / No / Not viable

**Total Weighted Score**:

**Relationship Metrics**:

## Red Flags: When to Pass on a Grant

### Automatic "No":
- ❌ Requires 501(c)(3) status and won't accept fiscal sponsorship
- ❌ Deadlines <2 weeks away with complex application
- ❌ Mission is completely unrelated to our work
- ❌ Requires matching funds we don't have and can't raise
- ❌ Reporting requirements exceed our capacity (e.g., RCT evaluation)

### Proceed with Caution:
- ⚠️ Requires audited financials (we don't have yet, but can sometimes waive for startups)
- ⚠️ Highly competitive (100+ applications for 5 awards)
- ⚠️ Very small amount (<$5K) with extensive application
- ⚠️ Funder has reputation for slow payments or difficult relationship
- ⚠️ Restrictions on indirect costs/overhead (can't cover true costs)

**Next Steps**:
1. Identify your top 3 focus areas from Tier 1-2 list
2. Research 10 potential funders in each focus area
3. Add to Grant Pipeline Notion database
4. Schedule 2 hours/week for ongoing grant research
5. Begin outreach using templates from [03-OUTREACH-TEMPLATES.md](03-OUTREACH-TEMPLATES.md)

**Pro Tip**: Start with local/regional funders first. They're more likely to take a chance on an emerging organization, and winning 2-3 small grants builds credibility for larger asks.
