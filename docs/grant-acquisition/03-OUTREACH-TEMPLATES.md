Dear [Program Officer Name / Selection Committee],

I am writing to submit a Letter of Inquiry on behalf of the ISIAH TARIK HOWARD TRUST for consideration under [Grant Program Name]. We are seeking [$XX,XXX] to [1-sentence project description].

**ORGANIZATIONAL BACKGROUND**

The ISIAH TARIK HOWARD TRUST, operating in coordination with IKE Solutions LLC, provides integrated legal advocacy, technology tools, and family stabilization services for low-income families in Newark, NJ facing eviction, disability discrimination, and debt collection abuse. Founded in 2024 by Isiah T. Howard—an SSA-disabled individual with lived experience navigating systemic barriers—we address intersecting challenges through trauma-informed, tech-enabled interventions.

We serve:
- Families with disabled household members experiencing ADA violations
- Low-income renters at risk of wrongful eviction
- Individuals facing predatory debt collection practices
- Communities lacking access to affordable legal representation

**PROJECT SUMMARY**

[Choose one based on grant focus]:

- Emergency rental assistance to prevent homelessness
- Case management and referrals to long-term support systems

- Software development and user testing
- Training materials and technical assistance

We operate a lean, tech-enabled model, maximizing impact per dollar with <20% overhead.
