# CFPB COMPLAINT - VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC.
## Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Complaint Filing

**Complaint Against:** Verizon Communications Inc.  
**Complaint Type:** Billing Dispute, Forced Payment, Debt Collection, ADA Discrimination  
**Consumer:** Isiah Tarik Howard  
**Date:** December 8, 2025

---

## WHAT HAPPENED

I am a disabled individual (verified by Social Security Administration, effective August 1, 2024) who has been systematically harmed by Verizon Communications Inc. through:

1. **Wrongful disconnection** of wireless and internet services during active billing dispute
2. **Forced payments under duress** (two payments totaling $800+) to restore essential services
3. **Payment misapplication** - 10+ confirmed payments not credited to account
4. **Continued collection activity** during active regulatory complaints
5. **Denial of disability accommodations** blocking access to federal benefits
6. **Refusal to investigate** documented payment discrepancies

## PAYMENT DISCREPANCY DETAILS

### Payments Made with Confirmation Numbers

Between July 2024 and November 2025, I made **10 payments totaling $1,104.60** to my Verizon accounts. Each payment was accompanied by a Verizon-issued confirmation number.

**However, Verizon claims:**
- Wireless account balance: $792.91 (per 11/02/2025 collection email)
- Fios account balance: $411.63 (per 10/05/2025 email)
- Total claimed debt: $1,204.54

**The math doesn't work:**
- If I paid $1,104.60 with confirmations
- And they claim I owe $1,204.54
- That's only $100 difference - NOT $800+ in arrears

**Discrepancy: $803.66 unaccounted for**

Additionally, a 10/05/2025 email from Verizon stated "no payment received $0" which is factually false and documented with confirmation numbers.

## FORCED PAYMENTS UNDER DURESS

### Payment #1 (November 2025) - Approximately $400
- Verizon disconnected my wireless service during active billing dispute
- I had a critical Social Security disability appointment requiring phone access
- I was **forced to pay approximately $400** just to have service restored temporarily
- This payment was made under duress, not voluntary agreement

### Payment #2 (December 8, 2025) - Amount TBD
- Verizon again disconnected both wireless AND Fios services
- Executive Relations confirmed: "cannot restore service even if payment made today"
- I am being forced to make ANOTHER payment today to restore services
- This is the **second forced payment during active FCC and BPU complaints**

**FDCPA Violation:** Forcing payments during active disputes violates Fair Debt Collection Practices Act §809(b) which requires ceasing collection activity during validation period.

**UDAAP Violation:** Forcing disabled individual to pay disputed amounts under threat of service disconnection = unfair, deceptive, abusive act or practice.

---

## DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION (ADA)

### My Disability Status
- Social Security disability approved effective August 1, 2024
- Low income verified by SSA
- Housing instability documented
- Phone service essential for:
  - SSA disability communications
  - Medical appointment coordination
  - Federal benefits access
  - Emergency services
  - Banking (2FA authentication codes)

### Verizon's Discriminatory Actions

1. **Disconnected services** knowing I'm disabled and need them for federal benefits
2. **Refused reasonable accommodations** despite multiple requests
3. **Forced payments** creating discriminatory financial barrier
4. **Ignored ADA implications** in all communications
5. **No escalation to ADA compliance team** despite explicit disclosure

**Impact:**
- Cannot receive SSA phone calls about my benefits
- Cannot access federal benefits portals (no internet)
- Cannot receive 2FA codes to access bank accounts
- Cannot coordinate medical care
- Cannot access emergency services

## COLLECTION ACTIVITY DURING ACTIVE DISPUTES

### Timeline of Regulatory Complaints
- **October 2025:** Filed FCC complaint
- **October 2025:** Filed NJ BPU complaint
- **November 2025:** Verizon continues collection emails
- **November 2025:** Services disconnected during active complaints
- **December 2025:** Continued collection activity, second forced payment demanded

**Verizon's Collection Emails During Disputes:**
- "Collections activity update" - demanding payment
- "Important account notice – interruption of service" - threatening termination
- "Your Fios service has been suspended" - pay now demands
- Zero acknowledgment of pending regulatory investigations

**FDCPA §809(b):** Collection activity must STOP when debt is disputed and validation requested.

**CFPB Authority:** CFPB has jurisdiction over unfair debt collection practices by non-bank entities providing consumer financial services.

---

## VERIZON'S REFUSAL TO INVESTIGATE

### What I Requested
1. Complete payment history showing all confirmation numbers
2. Forensic accounting audit of payment allocation
3. Explanation for $803.66 discrepancy
4. Authenticated contract showing agreed terms
5. Itemized billing with service dates
6. Suspension of collection pending investigation

### What Verizon Provided
**NOTHING.**

Instead, Verizon:
- Sent template dismissal letter to FCC
- Claimed "no payment received" in October 2025 email (false)
- Executive Relations agent stated "last payment I see is June" (false - I have recent confirmations)
- Declared matter "final" without investigation
- Admitted in letter: "Nothing in this letter should be construed as a full and complete recitation of the facts"

**This is an admission they did NOT investigate but still dismissed my complaint.**

---

## SYSTEMIC CORPORATE STRUCTURE FAILURE

### The "Fatal Flaw" Admitted by Verizon

**Problem:** Verizon Wireless and Verizon Fios are treated as completely separate companies internally.

**Impact on Consumers:**
1. Support agents cannot see unified customer data
2. Executive Relations cannot access both accounts simultaneously
3. Billing disputes require dealing with multiple disconnected departments
4. Payment investigations cannot be coordinated
5. **Even the highest level of support cannot resolve cross-service issues**

**Evidence from Recorded Calls:**
- Fios agent: "I don't see wireless account"
- Wireless agent: "That's a different department"
- Executive Relations: "I cannot touch wireless account" (when asked to prevent disconnection)

When I pointed out this was "a fatal flaw that could be extremely damaging to the parent company," the Executive Relations agent responded: **"I understand."**

**CFPB Implication:** This corporate structure creates systematic consumer harm and prevents effective dispute resolution. Verizon Communications Inc. is the parent company and must be held accountable for unified consumer protection.

## FINANCIAL HARM

- $803.66+ in unaccounted payments
- $400+ forced payment #1 (under duress)

- Late fees on disputed amounts

### Consequential Harm
- Unable to access bank accounts (no 2FA codes)

## CONSUMER STATEMENT

I am a disabled individual on limited income, struggling with housing instability, trying to maintain access to essential federal benefits. Verizon has:

- Taken my money and not credited it properly
- Disconnected essential services during active disputes
- Forced me to pay additional amounts under threat
- Refused to investigate documented evidence
- Denied disability accommodations
- Continued collection while regulatory complaints are pending

**This is not a billing dispute. This is systematic financial abuse of a vulnerable consumer.**

I am requesting CFPB intervention because:
1. Verizon refuses to investigate internally
2. FCC complaint process is ongoing but services remain disconnected
3. I cannot wait months for resolution while unable to access federal benefits
4. The financial harm is immediate and ongoing

**I need my services restored NOW and a proper accounting of where my payments went.**
